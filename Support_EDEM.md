# Support EDEM simulations

Iota is able to load and post-process the simulation data generated by [EDEM](http://www.edemsimulation.com) software. From the version EDEM 2017, the native files generated by EDEM can be read by Iota and data export is not required. Users can load the simulation data using the following function:

```python
iota.dataset.load_edem(edem_file = 'My_EDEM_simulation.dem')
```
