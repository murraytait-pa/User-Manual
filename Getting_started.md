# Getting started with Iota

This section provides an introduction on how to start using the Iota software. Particularly, it will focus on how to use and Iota and its Python Library using [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html).

The [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html) is installed during the installation process of Iota. Users can start Jupyter by clicking on the shortcut "Iota Jupyter" that can be found the "Iota" folder at the Start menu of their operative system.

After clicking on the "Iota Jupyter" shortcut, a command window will be open and after a few seconds, the home page of Jupyter will be automatically open in a tab of the user's default web browser (see picture below). This home page shows the content of the working directory of Iota. By default, this working directory is the "ParicleAnalytics" folder located in the user's home directory of the operative system (e.g. `C:/Users/Stephen/ParticleAnalytics`).

Users need an Iota notebook in order analyze their simulation data. A new notebook can be created by clicking on the "**New**" button located at the top right side of the window. Then select the  option "Notebook:" > "**iota**" from the drop-down menu.

The new empty notebook will be created and opened in new tab in your web browser. The image below shows an empty notebook.

As a good practice, it is recommended to create first a folder for your analysis and then create the notebook inside that folder. In this way, the images, videos or other files generated during the analysis will be stored inside that folder by default. A new folder can be created from the Jupyter home page by clicking on the "New" button located at the right side of the window and then selecting the option "Other:" > "Folder". Alternatively, the folder can also be created using the standard procedure of the operative system.

A notebook represents a journal where the steps conducted for the analysis of simulation data are recorded. It contains a sequence of cells where users can execute python provided by the Iota Python Library to load and analyze their simulation data.



For more detailed information about notebooks, please see the following link: [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html)

. A cell is a multiline text input field, and its contents can be executed by using Shift-Enter, or by clicking either the “Play” button the toolbar, or Cell, Run in the menu bar. The execution behavior of a cell is determined by the cell’s type. There are three types of cells: code cells, markdown cells, and raw cells. Every cell starts off being a code cell, but its type can be changed by using a drop-down on the toolbar (which will be “Code”, initially), or via keyboard shortcuts.
